K Means Code:
1. It is a python based code.
2. Installation of Python 3.4.3 is required(I have used Anaconda 2.3 |Spyder 2 Editor)
3. In python shell use command: python kmeans.py
4. Keep csv files in same folder.

Running:
1. Enter data filename (It is hard coded as iristwod.csv/atttwod.csv).
2. The code also plots the graph for the resulting clusters.
3. The number of clusters is hardcoded.(Here, K=3)
4. The Maximum number of Iterations is also hard coded.(for good results::att:5 iris:10)

Results:
1. The sample outputs are saved in the html files from the Anaconda IDE.
2. att_kmeans.html  and iris_kmeans.html are the results of the ATT and Iris datasets.
3. The graphs are ploted using different markers and shape.
