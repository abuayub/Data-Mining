Read me for Visualising of Data(Plotting):

- Plotting is done manually by using the output files of "SVD.py".
- The code is run separately on both the datasets (Iris and Att).
- The plotting is done using MS Excel tool.
- The plotted graphs are in separate sheets of the same file.
- The graphs are ploted using different markers and shape.
